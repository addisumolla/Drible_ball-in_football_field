# OpenGL Dribbling Ball Simulation

This project showcases a simple yet engaging simulation of a ball being dribbled on a field using OpenGL computer graphics. The primary focus is on demonstrating the principles of graphics rendering and basic physics in a 2D environment.

**Features:**

* **Realistic Ball Movement:** The ball is programmed to simulate realistic dribbling motion, responding to user inputs for direction and speed.

* **Interactive Field:** The field is designed to provide a visual context for the ball's movement, enhancing the overall user experience.

* **Graphics Rendering:** The project utilizes OpenGL for rendering the ball and the field, showcasing the capabilities of this powerful graphics library.

**language and library Used:**

* **OpenGL:** For rendering graphics and handling the visual aspects of the simulation.

* **GLUT:** For managing the window and handling user input.

* **C++:** The programming language used to implement the game logic and graphics.
